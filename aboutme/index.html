                Hi, I'm Enes Cevik! I'm a data enthusiast with a passion for turning complex information into valuable insights. 
                With a background in data analytics and business development, I've worked on projects ranging from predictive maintenance 
                to sales forecasting, always focusing on making data-driven decisions that bring real impact. Originally from Turkey and now 
                based in Chapel Hill, NC, I've embraced my new environment, continuously learning and growing in the field of data science. 
                Outside of work, I love exploring new recipes in the kitchen and trading strategies as a hobby. I'm excited to connect with 
                like-minded professionals and share my journey. Thanks for visiting!
